# Intro

You are looking at a so-called [Slush](https://github.com/klei/slush) generator template. Slush is described as a scaffolding system. It provides a generic framework to perform scaffolding tasks using Gulp. We use Slush here to ramp up a new project folder with a single command. It will create a REST-type MarkLogic Roxy project for you, copy a node.js/AngularJS stack on top of it, and run some initialization commands for you, all in a single run.

It comes with a barebones application, with a few of the most commonly used features already in place. Otherwise it is kept as clean, and empty as possible, to allow users like you to quickly blend in whatever you are going to need for your project.
